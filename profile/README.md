# gotunnel

Importable Go library that can be embedded inside your code to expose your locally running service to a public server. It serves as an open-source alternative to ngrok.

Almost every alternative project is either not open-source or exists as a standalone service or CLI that has to be run separately on your server. And can't be directly imported inside your code. This library, however, solves that.

* Check out the [base library](https://github.com/gotunnel/gotunnel).
* Standalone CLI coming soon!
* Prehosted server package coming soon!
